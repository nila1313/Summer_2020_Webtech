My Monday was a lot of fun! I started with checking my email, making a planning for the month & then it was time to go to the gym.



It was the first time going to the gym since the quarantine started & it felt very good to be back again. I walked home afterwards, because I already felt a huge soreness coming up & it was nice to enjoy the weather and walk in the city.



I really felt like cooking a healthy meal after my workout, so I decided to make myself this delicious pasta with red bell pepper, zucchini & tomatoes. I also had a few pieces of bread ðŸ¥– left that I had earlier that day & would go perfectly with the pasta sauce. I made extra for later that week (meal prepping).
